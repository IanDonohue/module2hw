            <p>A long time ago, denkoes did not have stoobles so they went everywhere on tabblings. The
                streets were rempled but it took too much jawbydosh to get to pralinkot. If it rained, the
                children would put on their craxozob and deshel-peshel through the puddles. At night,
                everyone would flishlinkle and nardogunt until it was dark.</p>
